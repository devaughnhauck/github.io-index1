		<h1>Phi Kappa Sigma ΦKΣ</h1> <br> You've made it this far? That means a lot to me :) 
		<br> I guess that means that I can tell you a little bit about my Fraternity... <p>
		As of Saturday, February 10, 2018, I am officially a brother of Phi Kappa Sigma, Alpha Delta Chapter <br> 
		Over the course of the Fall 2017 semester, I was a pledge grinding and balancing between school and Fraternity <p>

		<br><br> A little info about the Fraternity is that at University of Maine it was founded in the year 1898. 
		<br> The Fraternity was founded in 1850 at the University of Pennsylvania by 7 Founding Fathers:
		<ul>
			<ol>
			<li>Dr. Samual Brown Wylie Mitchell</li>
			<li>Andrew Adams Ripka</li>
